export const code = examples.find(x => x.name === "Partial application").code;

# Hello world
This is the first test of markdown based examples!

<MdMachine client:load step={176} program={code} garbage_collection collapse_indirections>
	**Test**
	You can use normal code blocks.
	```stg
	foldl = FUN(f acc list -> 
		case list of {
		Nil  -> acc;
		Cons h t -> let newAcc = THUNK(f acc h)
					in foldl f newAcc t;
		}
	)
	```
	But if your code is in a variable, you have to use the CodeBlock component explicitly.
	CodeBlock and MdMachine are imported by default, other components/functions need to be imported explicitly.
	<CodeBlock code={code} lang={"stg"} file={undefined}/>
	<stack/>
	<heap/>
</MdMachine>
